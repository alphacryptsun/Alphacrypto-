Select an option:

1. Enter Alpha Character Set


2. Enter Numerical Value


3. Set Deciphering Rules


4. Choose Preset Decipher


5. Set Custom Capitalization Rule


6. Exit

1. Enter Alpha Character Set

Prompt:
"Please enter the alpha character set you'd like to work with (letters only)."

Behavior with Updated Rules:

1. Input: Takes user input (e.g., "Test").


2. Default Rules Applied in this Order:

Pushed Together Rule

Capitalization Rule

Reverse Rule





---

Example Interaction (Updated Rules):

Input: "Test"

Transformations:


1. Pushed Together Rule:

Removes spaces from the input (if any).

Input remains "Test".



2. Capitalization Rule:

Default: Custom rule (capitalize E, Y, A, and L only).

Forward: "tEst"

Backward: "tsEt"



3. Reverse Rule:

Forward: "tEst"

Backward: "tsEt"




Output:

Forward: "tEst"

Backward: "tsEt"



---

Sub-menu after entering character set:

1. Select a Letter

Choose a letter for further operations like adding, removing, or changing.



2. Add Letter

Specify a letter to be added to the current character set and its position.



3. Remove Letter

Select a letter to be removed from the current character set.



4. Change Working Alphacharacter Set

Switch between available sets (Forward, Reverse, Forward2, Reverse2, etc.).



5. List All Deciphers

View the complete catalog of all transformations performed.



6. New Capitalization Rule

Set a new rule (e.g., All Caps, Custom).



7. Undo Last Change

Revert the last modification.



8. View Undo History

Review the history of all transformations.



9. Go Back to Main Menu




---

2. Enter Numerical Value

1. Alpha-to-Numeric Conversion

"T" → 7 → "seven"

"E" → 3 → "three"

Result: "seven three seven t"



2. Embed Today's Date

Adds current date dynamically (e.g., "27th January 2025").



3. Custom Numerical Transformations

Based on predefined or user-defined rules.





---

3. Set Deciphering Rules

Default Active Rules (Updated):

1. ! Pushed Together Rule (First Priority)

Ensures no spaces in the character set.



2. ! Capitalization Rule (Second Priority)

Default: Capitalize E, Y, A, and L.



3. ! Reverse Rule (Third Priority)

Displays both forward and backward character sets.





---

4. Choose Preset Decipher

1. Straight Tear Down (Automatic):

Automatically applies a linear breakdown.

Input: "tEst" → Output: "t", "E", "s", "t".



2. Straight Tear Down (Interactive):

Allows the user to decide how the character set is broken down interactively.



3. Rocking Method (Automatic):

Applies an automatic rocking pattern to the input.

Input: "tEst" → Output: "tE", "sT".



4. Rocking Method (Interactive):

User inputs how the rocking pattern should apply.





---

Updated Example Workflow

Step 1: Input

Input: "Test"

1. Pushed Together Rule:

Input remains "Test".



2. Capitalization Rule:

Forward: "tEst"

Backward: "tsEt".



3. Reverse Rule:

Forward: "tEst"

Backward: "tsEt".




Output:

Forward: "tEst"

Backward: "tsEt"



---

Step 2: Rocking Method

Input: "tEst"

Output:

Forward2: "tEst" → "tE", "sT"

Backward2: "tsEt" → "ts", "Et"




---

Step 3: Add Letter

Action: Add "E" between "S" and "T".

Output:

Forward2: "tEsEt"

Backward2: "tsEts"
